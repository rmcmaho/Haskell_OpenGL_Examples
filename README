OpenGL Example Conversion
============================
This project is an attempt to convert the OpenGL examples from C to Haskell.
http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/glut_examples/examples/examples.html

Where possible, the Haskell code resembles the C code as closely as possible. This is an attempt to help myself and others learn how to program OpenGL in Haskell.
